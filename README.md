## Basic Shell Implementation in C
This project was made under the tutorial of Stephen Brennan. Big Shoutout to him. 
This was an interesting project to do. Mostly because I had no idea what a shell was
even though I have used bash in the past and WSL.

Now, the first mistake I made is that this project was created on Windows. Yes.
Despite my attempt at trying to teach myself how to be a software engineer I messed up
at step number 1. So if you so happen to read this, please do not be an idiot like I was,
and make the project right off the bat on Ubuntu. While the git history does show that I
have in fact completed this project on the same project folder, I did have to migrate my files
to WSL to make testing possible. Will I publish the other project to GitHub? I don't know, maybe?

Anyways conclusion is do your research first and do not be an idiot if you're on Windows.
